Whilst in India I got to travel around the world. I first went to Paris in 2009, then to London in 2010 then London again in 2011 for a cruise around the Mediterranean Sea where I got to visit Gibraltar, France, Spain and Portugal. I then moved back to Australia later that same year. In August 2013, about 2 years after getting back from India, I moved down to South Gippsland where I currently live. In 2019 I finished Year 12 then in March 2020 I started my Bachelor of Information Technology.

### Interest in IT:

- Interest in IT: My main interest in IT revolves around studying and working with the latest technology. Given my various disabilities, I have always been interested in robotics, self-driving cars and other such technology that will allow me to lead a more independent life.
- Why did I choose to come to RMIT: The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because it offered the best course options regarding IT. A qualification in this degree will give me a broader range of job opportunities.
