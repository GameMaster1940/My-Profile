### Interest in IT:

- Interest in IT: My main interest in IT revolves around studying and working with the latest technology. Given my various disabilities, I have always been interested in robotics, self-driving cars and other such technology that will allow me to lead a more independent life.
- Why did I choose to come to RMIT: The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because it offered the best course options regarding IT. A qualification in this degree will give me a broader range of job opportunities.
- What did I expect to learn from my studies: From my studies I was mainly hoping to obtain broad spectrum skills around IT, more specifically learning skills that revolve around all different areas of programming.

What do the results of these tests mean for you? Even though I am shy I am observant and a deep thinker. I prefer facts to opinions and will not hesitate to speak up when necessary. I need to be careful to respect other people’s opinions.

How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team I would be a good researcher because I prefer facts to opinions. I am good at administrative tasks. I am very visual and a good observer. Whilst I am shy, I will speak up when I feel it’s necessary.

How should you take this into account when forming a team? I must be careful not to be too judgemental of other people’s opinion. Potentially, I would work best in a team whose members rely on facts rather than opinion. 

### Project Idea:

Summary: 
- My idea for a project is to create a game revolving around the Cold War called Heart of Iron: Cold War. The game would be centred around a timeline from January 1st, 1946 to January 1st, 2000. This game would start off with the outbreak of the second phase of the Chinese Civil War and would include all major Cold War events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. It would allow the player to change history with lots of different alternative history pathways. The game would allow the players to play as any country that existed during this period of history such as Nationalist China, the USA and the Soviet Union.

Motivation:
- My main reason for wanting to create a Cold War game is because of the success of Paradox Interactive’s video game Hearts of Iron IV which makes it clear that the idea for video games revolving around world war 2 is a very popular concept. Paradox Interactive also did try once in the past to make a video game called East vs West which was a game meant to focus on the Cold War and goes from 1946 to 1991. Due to issues in development this game got cancelled and was never released. Since then no other video game developer has tried to make a game revolving around the Cold War.

Description:
- The game itself would be using many of the features from Heart of Iron IV to enable people who have played Heart of Iron IV to become quickly familiar with the concept of playing this Cold War game. Like Heart IV it would have focus trees which would be decisions that would help guide the player’s country in the direction of their choice. When it comes to focus trees, countries would have a focus tree for the changes at the start of each new decade. The first focus tree would be from 1946 to 1949, then the second would be from 1950 to 1959, the third one from 1960 to 1969 and so on until you reach the last decade which would be from 1990 to 1999. By having the game broken up into different decades it would allow the player to get the most out of each decade. The player would be able to choose from multiple start dates. The start dates would be in order from first to last January 1st, 1946 which is the Chinese Civil War, January 1st, 1950, which is the Korean War, January 1st 1960 which is the Vietnam War, January 1st 1970 which is the later part of the Vietnam War, January 1st 1980 which is the start of the later phase of the Cold War and January 1st 1990 which is the decade that would mark the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War.  Heart of Iron IV would have 4 ideologies: Democratic, Communist, Fascist and Non-Aligned. In sticking with this sort of idea there would be three ideologies: Western Aligned, Eastern Aligned and Non-Aligned. Within each ideology there would be sub ideologies. For Western Aligned there would be centre left, centre right and autocracy. For Eastern Aligned there would be Marxism–Leninism and Maoism. For Non-Aligned there would be centre left, centre right, non-aligned communism, non-aligned fascism and neutral. Another part of the game would be research. So, you would be able to research different technology which would be split by the era, so that if you research a 1960s technology in the 1950s it would take longer given that it is future technology. There would be two main factions, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, although other factions like the Non-Aligned Movement would exist also. There would be 5 major powers at the start of the game: US, France, UK, China and the Soviet Union. Like in any wartime situation involving multiple major powers, you would only need to defeat the major powers to end the war. The major powers could change over time since the major powers are classified as the countries in the top 5 when it comes to scoring – like any Heart of Iron IV. One of the main features of the game would allow you to destroy your enemy (assuming they don’t also have nuclear weapons) and to easily allow you to win the war.

Tools and Technologies: 
- This game would be written and developed using Paradox Development Studio’s in-house Clausewitz Engine. It’s a custom engine made by Paradox Development Studio to develop their own games. You would also preferably need a Windows computer that is running Windows 10 although this is not a mandatory requirement. The computer would need to have a good amount of memory and storage in order to store such things as the game files. If using a desktop computer, a good quality computer monitor would also be a good idea. The ability to be able to test a good quality graphics card is another good idea for testing the quality of the computer graphics in the game.

Skills Required: 
- Skills needed for this include basic level of knowledge when it comes to programming, knowledge in using the software needed to develop the game and knowledge on how to use a windows 10 based computer. You would also need skills when it comes to graphic design as the game’s graphics would also need to be made. The game would come with its own soundtrack, so skill in this area would be required. Another skill would be to have good knowledge of the Cold War and the events surrounding it such as the Korean War and Vietnam War. 

Outcome: 
- If the project was successful, the outcome would be that I would have a game that I hope would become popular and make a lot of money. It would solve my issue of there being very few high-quality Cold War based games. This game would become another addition to the Heart of Iron series.
