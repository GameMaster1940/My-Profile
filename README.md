Whilst in India I got to travel around the world. I first went to Paris in 2009, then to London in 2010 then London again in 2011 for a cruise around the Mediterranean Sea where I got to visit Gibraltar, France, Spain and Portugal. I then moved back to Australia later that same year. In August 2013, about 2 years after getting back from India, I moved down to South Gippsland where I currently live. In 2019 I finished Year 12 then in March 2020 I started my Bachelor of Information Technology.

### Interest in IT:

- Interest in IT: My main interest in IT revolves around studying and working with the latest technology. Given my various disabilities, I have always been interested in robotics, self-driving cars and other such technology that will allow me to lead a more independent life.
- Why did I choose to come to RMIT: The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because it offered the best course options regarding IT. A qualification in this degree will give me a broader range of job opportunities.
- What did I expect to learn from my studies: From my studies I was mainly hoping to obtain broad spectrum skills around IT, more specifically learning skills that revolve around all different areas of programming.

What do the results of these tests mean for you? Even though I am shy I am observant and a deep thinker. I prefer facts to opinions and will not hesitate to speak up when necessary. I need to be careful to respect other people’s opinions.

How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team I would be a good researcher because I prefer facts to opinions. I am good at administrative tasks. I am very visual and a good observer. Whilst I am shy, I will speak up when I feel it’s necessary.

How should you take this into account when forming a team? I must be careful not to be too judgemental of other people’s opinion. Potentially, I would work best in a team whose members rely on facts rather than opinion.
